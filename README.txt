A template to collect and showcase bitsy games. Feel free to use it for your own private underground arcades, public games exhibitions, to show your friends or show the world. Copy it, hack it, edit it, cut it, add to it, do whatever you wish to it.

You'll have to set up your own local server for the template to work. I use XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

If you need any help, have any questions or would like me to make you a custom bitsy mixer page you can contact me at:

or drop me a DM on twitter at: https://twitter.com/moreelen

Enjoy!
